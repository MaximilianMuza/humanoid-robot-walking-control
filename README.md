# Humanoid-Robot-Walking-Control
In this course, students are to learn essential materials for bipedal walking control of humanoid robots. Students will learn the control theory for walking. Then, simulation tools are used to implement and test what they learned in class. Project will require to understand some advanced technique and produce a working demo.

## Weekly Homeworks
The weekly assignments are focused on simulating various control methods within the ROS (Robot Operating System) simulation environment for a bipedal humanoid robot.

1) Inverse kinematics for robot's legs
2) ZMP planning
3) Offline CoM planning
4) Foot trajectory generation, CoM closed loop control
5) Compliant control using disturbance observer
6) Online CoM generation using ZMP preview control
7) Walking pattern generation using CoM control
8) Wakling pattern generation using capture point control
9) ..
10) ..

## Project
The objective of the project is to conduct research on walking control mechanisms for humanoid robots and subsequently implement a control method aimed at enhancing the robot's walking speed.
